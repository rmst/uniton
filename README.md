# Uniton ‚Äì Instrumentalize Unity with Python

Uniton lets you control the Unity game engine from Python. It aims to instrumentalize Unity and make it more useful in non-game applications.

[comment]: <> (I'm also considering making an editor-focussed version of Uniton to facilitate world creation and asset management.)


### Installation
Uniton requires Python 3.7+. We recommend the Anaconda/Miniconda distribution but it will work with others just as well. Install the Uniton Python package via `pip install uniton`.

To use Uniton with your own Unity project, simply drop the ‚Äì [__uniton.dll__](https://github.com/uniton-dev/uniton/releases/latest/download/uniton.dll) ‚Äì  into your project's `Asset` folder.

### Usage
Uniton also comes with pre-built example environments that automatically download when they are first used. Below are two examples but there are more. Check out [uniton/examples](https://github.com/uniton-dev/uniton/tree/main/examples)!

```python
# The kart game from the demo video
ue = uniton.examples.KartGame()

# A higher fidelity scene
ue = uniton.examples.Temple()
```


#### Uniton in your own Unity project
Any Unity project can become a Uniton project simply by dropping the `uniton.dll` somewhere into the project's asset folder.
Connect to your a running Unity app
To launch and connect to a Uniton app do
```python
import uniton
ue = uniton.UnityEngine(path='path/to/binary')
```

```python
ue = uniton.UnityEngine()

# Alternatively, to connect to a remote Uniton app do, e.g.
ue = uniton.UnityEngine(host='192.168.1.101', port=10001)

# The remote Uniton app can been launched via, e.g. 'UNITONHOST="0.0.0.0" UNITONPORT=10001 path/to/binary'
# Warning: UNITONHOST="0.0.0.0" should only ever be used in a private and secure network!
# It theoretically allows everyone on the network to control the host.
```


#### Control time via
```python
ue.pause()  # this can block the whole window when used in the Unity editor
ue.step()  # advances game time by ue.time.delta and renders one frame
# more steps, etc..
ue.resume()  # resume real time operation
```

#### Access game objects via
```python
ue.scene.<GameObjectName>.<ChildGameObjectName>

# Access components within game objects using lower camelcase
ue.scene.<GameObjectName>.<componentName>  # e.g. rigidbody, boxCollider, camera, light

# Transform attributes are directly available on the game object, e.g.
ue.scene.<GameObjectName>.position == ue.scene.<GameObjectName>.transform.position
```

#### Access any C# class via
```python
ue.<namespace>.<classname>

# The 'UnityEngine' namespace can be omitted, i.e.
ue.<classname> == ue.UnityEngine.<classname>

# Instantiate any C# class by calling it, as is usual in Python, e.g.
v = ue.Vector3(0, 1, 0)
```

#### Receiving values from C#/Unity
```python
v.x  # returns a placeholder object for the 'x' property of a C# Vector3 object
v.x.py # immediately returns a promise object and triggers the value of 'v.x' to be sent to Python asynchronously
v.x.py() # blocks until the value has been received and returns the value

# Currently, only a few types can be received directly, e.g. int, float, str, byte arrays.
```

#### Rendering and receiving frames
```python
from uniton import QueuedRenderer

renderer = QueuedRenderer(ue.scene.Main_Camera.Camera, width=512, height=256, render_steps=4, ipc_steps=3)
frame = renderer.render()  # will return a Numpy array of shape (256, 512, 3) and dtype 'uint8'
```

Internally, the frame is produced as follows.
```
Unity GPU (render) --render_queue--> Unity CPU --ipc_queue--> Python
```

Therefore, `frame` actually shows the state of the game a number of `renderer.render()`-calls earlier. To be precise, that number is

```python
renderer.delay() == render_steps + ipc_steps - 2
```

Consequently, the following will block and be slow but show the current state of the game.
```python
renderer = QueuedRenderer(ue.scene.Main_Camera.Camera, width=512, height=256, render_steps=1, ipc_steps=1)
frame = render.render()
```

### How does Uniton work?
Uniton creates placeholder objects for C# objects and functions. When a placeholder C# function is called from Python it will immediately return a new placeholder for the return value. This new placeholder object can be immediately worked with. Should the C# function throw an exception such that the actual return value never materializes, then Uniton will throw a delayed exception in Python. Attribute and method lookups on placeholder objects work the same way, as these lookups are also just functions calls internally.


### Limitations
- Generic C# classes and functions can't be used (please open an issue if this is important to you)
- Python functions can't be registered as C# callbacks (please open an issue if this is important to you)
- There is currently no documentation beyond this readme 


### Troubleshooting
In case that you aren't using Anaconda you might have to replace the `python` command with `python3` and the `pip` command with `python3 -m pip`. To maximize compatibilty you can install Uniton via
```bash
python3 -m pip install uniton --upgrade --user
```

### Uninstall
To remove Uniton including all example binaries that have been loaded run
```bash
python -m uniton delete_data
pip uninstall uniton
```

### License
Uniton is currently only partially open-source (https://pypi.org/project/uniton/). I might open-source all of it eventually. In the meantime, if you need access to the source code, please contact me at simonramstedt+uniton@gmail.com. Basic Uniton will always be free to use.
